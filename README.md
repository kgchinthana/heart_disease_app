## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- React
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- Bootstrap (for responsive design)

### Backend:
- Python Flask/Django (or your choice of backend framework)
- Scikit-learn (for the machine learning model)

### Others:
- Node.js
- Axios (for API calls)
- NPM (package manager)

## API Integration

The frontend app communicates with the backend API to get heart disease predictions. When the user submits the form, the input data is sent to the backend, and the prediction result is displayed.

### API Endpoint:

- **Endpoint URL:** `/predict`
- **Method:** POST
- **Payload:** JSON object containing user input data (e.g., age, cholesterol levels, etc.)
- **Response:** JSON object with the prediction result

Make sure the backend server is running and accessible by the frontend at the correct endpoint.
